# Family History Step

Use the Family History Step to collect insightful health trends.

## Overview

Obtaining accurate family health history is an extremely valueable data set to possibly prepare or avoid common health conditions a patient might face in the future. However, obtaining this information has always been a struggle when collected manually and even digitally. Now with ResearchKit, developers and researchers have the ability to quickly construct a ``ORKFamilyHistoryStep`` 
and present a family health history survey tailored to their specific needs. 

With the ``ORKFamilyHistoryStep`` you can specify:

- **Relative Types** - Determine the exact type of family members the survey asks about. 
- **Survey questions** - Use the same questions for each relative group or create a different survey for each.
