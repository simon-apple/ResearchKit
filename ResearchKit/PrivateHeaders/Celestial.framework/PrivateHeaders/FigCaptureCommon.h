	@enum FigCaptureVideoStabilizationMethod

		Constants indicating the modes of video stabilization supported by the device's format.
		It is configured by the application.

	@constant FigCaptureVideoStabilizationMethodOff
		Indicates that video should not be stabilized.
	@constant FigCaptureVideoStabilizationMethodStandard
		Standard video stabilization has a reduced field of view compared to FigCaptureVideoStabilizationMethodOff.
		The amount of overscan is 10%.
		Enabling video stabilization may introduce additional latency into the video capture pipeline.
	@constant FigCaptureVideoStabilizationMethodCinematic
		Cinematic video stabilization has a reduced field of view compared to FigCaptureVideoStabilizationMethodOff and it may have lesser field of view compared to FigCaptureVideoStabilizationMethodStandard.
		Enabling cinematic video stabilization introduces much more latency into the video capture pipeline than standard video stabilization and consumes significantly more system memory.
		The amount of overscan is 20%, it can be overridden using VideoStabilizationOverscanPercentageOverrideForCinematic key for each AVCaptureDeviceFormats in AVCaptureSession.plist.
 	@constant FigCaptureVideoStabilizationMethodCinematicExtended
		Cinematic extended video stabilization has a reduced field of view compared to FigCaptureVideoStabilizationMethodOff and it may have lesser field of view compared to FigCaptureVideoStabilizationMethodStandard.
		Enabling cinematic extended video stabilization introduces much more latency into the video capture pipeline than regular cinematic video stabilization and consumes significantly more system memory.
		The amount of overscan is 20% for video, or 10% for CTM LivePhoto if video stitching is disabled. It can be overridden using VideoStabilizationOverscanPercentageOverrideForCinematic key for each AVCaptureDeviceFormats in AVCaptureSession.plist.

	@constant FigCaptureVideoStabilizationTypeNone
		Indicates that video should not be stabilized.
	@constant FigCaptureVideoStabilizationTypeISP
		Indicates ISP VIS based stabilization where the ISP calculates the transform matrices and applies it to the video output and delivered the stabilized frames to CM.
	@constant FigCaptureVideoStabilizationTypeGPU
		Indicates GPU based stabilization where CM receives unstabilized video frames and GyroVideoStabilization SBP calculates the transform matrices and uses GPU for processing.
	@constant FigCaptureVideoStabilizationTypeISPStrip
		Indicates ISP based stabilization where CM receives unstabilized video frames and GyroVideoStabilization SBP calculates the transform matrices and uses ISP BES for processing using FigCaptureDeviceCreateISPProcessingSession.
