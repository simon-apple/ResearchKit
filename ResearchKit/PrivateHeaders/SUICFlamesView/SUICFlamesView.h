 Calls into Metal intialization code (when Metal support is detected), which is responsible for loading shaders and preparing pipelines. When shaders are loaded the first time on boot, the system will take additional time to run a full compile of these shaders. Calling prewarmShaders on boot will ensure the device has these shaders built and ready in the cache.
 @warning The call should be from a utility thread thread only, as this will spin up other processes based on this priority. Setting too low of a priority will cause this shared resource to get stuck scheduling our compile. Setting too high of a priority will slow down other parts of the system.
