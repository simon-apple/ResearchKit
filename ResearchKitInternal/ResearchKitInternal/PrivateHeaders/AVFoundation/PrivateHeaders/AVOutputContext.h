 @abstract		An AVOutputContext represents a choice of output destination for a playback object such as AVPlayer.
 @discussion
	An instance of AVOutputContext can be shared between multiple playback objects, which means that any output destination picked on that output context will be applied to each associated playback object.  This sharing implies that all objects associated with a particular context vie for the same output device, and the last one to get the context is allowed access to the output device.

	A context can be shared between multiple objects. In case of AirPlay video, this can be achieved by setting the same context on different AVPlayers using [AVPlayer setOutputContext:]. This sharing implies that all objects associated with a particular context vie for the same output device, and the last one to get the context is allowed access to the output device.

	*** PLEASE contact Core Media Engineering before using this method. ***

	This is to be used only by clients who are interested in picking audio for the all long-form audio apps on the system.  On macOS, use of this method requires the following entitlement:

		"com.apple.avfoundation.allow-system-wide-context" = true (Boolean)
 

	Use this context if your content is an audio presentation, such as music or podcasts.  This context should not be used for system or ambient sounds.  This output context is shared between every "music" application on the system so that the user can route all music to a particular output device.

	 -setOutputDevices: should be used when changing the destination of this output context instead of -setOutputDevice:options:.  To examine the current destination of this output context, use the outputDevices property instead of the outputDevice property.
